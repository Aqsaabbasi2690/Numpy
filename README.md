# NumPy Series: From Fundamentals to Real-World Applications

Welcome to the **NumPy Learning Series** â€“ a structured repository to help you master NumPy, the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. This series is designed to guide you step-by-step from basic array manipulations to real-world applications involving data and images.

## ðŸš€ Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following:

- Basic understanding of Python (variables, loops, functions, etc.)
- Python 3.x installed
- Required libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install numpy matplotlib Pillow
## ðŸ“š Series Outline
## âœ… Phase 1: NumPy Foundation
